# MuseDashBackgroundChanger
Change Background in Muse Dash Levels

## Usage 
Download files from whereever and place them in `Backgrounds`

## Extraction
Start the game with `--Export` (Right click in steam > Properties > Arguments > --Export)

this will create files that can later be edited

this takes a fair amount of time per theme so disable it when you don't want to extract

## Bugs
This is bound to have bugs if you find one dm me at `BustR75#2109` on discord
